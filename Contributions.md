# Contributing Guidelines

If you want to contribute to this list (please do), send me a pull request or contact me @zwang4. 


*Before opening a new pull request, it's helpful to search the current list and the existing pulls - it's possible
that another user has already reported your item.

In order for a pull request to be accepted, it needs to pass this list of requirements:

- It should follow the link template*.
- The addition should be correctly classified as a paper, a blog post, a talk, a software or a dataset.
- It shouldn't be a duplicate.

*Link template:

```
* [Title](URL) - Description.
```
For papers, it should include the authors.


### Deprecation

A listed repository should be deprecated if:

* Repository's owner explicitly says that "this library is not maintained".
* Not committed for long time (2~3 years).

To mark a repository as deprecated, put `[DEPRECATED]` before the title and move it at the bottom of the list.
